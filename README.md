### What is this:
 A python program that does some encryption process by interacting with a portable OpenSSL application.
 
### What can this do?
 - AES-128-EBC / AES-128-CBC Symmetric Encryption
 - SHA 1 / SHA 256 / SHA 512 Hash Function
 - RSA-2048 Public Key Encryption
 - ECDSA Signing

### What do I need to run this?
 - Latest Python 3.x (3.7+ minimum)
 - A 64 bit computer

### How do I install this?
 - Download the files in this repository
 - Go to the python-openssl folder. Click ___Installation.bat
 - Wait for it to finish.
 - Click ____Run.bat
 - If a console UI appeared, then its all alright

### Will this project be expanded in the future?
 - By Me? No. But you can clone this, or take some inspiration from this and expand beyond it.

### What if I have a 32-bit computer?
 - Hmmm, maybe you can download the 32bit version of OpenSSL on this website: https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html. Install it on your desktop and get the files extracted from it and replace the already existing OpenSSL folder inside the "bin" folder of "app" folder.

### What if I have a Python 3.5 below or Python 2.x?
 - The code might not work (Py 3.5 >) The code will not work (Py 2.x). Just update you python version please. Or download a python version on the python website itself. Two versions can co-exist. Plus, this application uses a virtual python environment so it shouldn't really mess with your already existing packages.
